Created this prediction model using Naive Bayes machine learning to predict whether weather conditions are suitable for playing or not , using the classic PlaySheet dataset.
By leveraging the Naive Bayes classifier, the model analyzes features like outlook, temperature, humidity, and wind to achieve reliable predictions. 
The simplicity of the dataset and model ensures interpretability while providing insights into the factors influencing decision-making. 
This project serving as an educational tool for understanding probabilistic classification and real-world decision-making under uncertain conditions.
